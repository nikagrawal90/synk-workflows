THE COURT: Good morning, counsel. We are back on the record in the matter of ACME Corporation versus Global Tech Solutions. This is Day 2 of our bench trial. Mr. Chen, you may call your next witness.

MR. CHEN: Thank you, Your Honor. The plaintiff calls Dr. Robert Williams to the stand.

THE CLERK: Please raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?

DR. WILLIAMS: I do.

THE CLERK: Please state your name and spell your last name for the record.

DR. WILLIAMS: Robert Williams, W-I-L-L-I-A-M-S.

DIRECT EXAMINATION
BY MR. CHEN:

Q: Dr. Williams, what is your current occupation?

A: I am a cybersecurity expert and consultant. I've been working in the field for over 20 years.

Q: Can you describe your educational background?

A: I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from MIT and a Master's degree in Cybersecurity from Stanford University.

MR. CHEN: Your Honor, I move to qualify Dr. Williams as an expert in cybersecurity and network security systems.

MS. RODRIGUEZ: No objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Dr. Williams is qualified as an expert. You may proceed.

Q: Dr. Williams, were you retained by ACME Corporation to conduct an analysis in this case?

A: Yes, I was.

Q: What were you asked to analyze?

A: I was asked to examine the security breach that occurred at ACME's data center on March 15, 2024, and determine the source and method of the breach.

Q: And what did your investigation reveal?

A: My investigation revealed that the breach originated from malicious code embedded in software provided by Global Tech Solutions. The code created a backdoor that allowed unauthorized access to ACME's customer database.

MS. RODRIGUEZ: Objection, Your Honor. Foundation. There's been no showing that Dr. Williams examined the actual code or had access to Global Tech's proprietary systems.

THE COURT: Sustained. Mr. Chen, please lay a proper foundation.

Q: Dr. Williams, did you have access to the relevant code for your analysis?

A: Yes. I examined both the source code provided by Global Tech Solutions under discovery and the compiled code running on ACME's servers.

Q: And how did you conduct your analysis?

A: I performed a line-by-line code review, conducted penetration testing, and traced the data exfiltration patterns through network logs spanning a three-month period.

Q: What specific evidence did you find that connected the breach to Global Tech's software?

A: I found three key pieces of evidence. First, the backdoor code contained unique identifiers that matched Global Tech's development environment. Second, the communication protocol used by the backdoor matched Global Tech's proprietary API structure. Third, the timestamps on the malicious code predated ACME's implementation, indicating it was present in the original software delivery.

MR. CHEN: Your Honor, I'd like to introduce Plaintiff's Exhibit 47, which is Dr. Williams' expert report.

THE COURT: Any objection, Ms. Rodriguez?

MS. RODRIGUEZ: We object on the grounds that portions of the report contain hearsay and speculation.

THE COURT: I'll allow the report into evidence. The weight to be given to any hearsay or opinions will be determined by the court. Exhibit 47 is admitted.

Q: Dr. Williams, in your expert opinion, was this breach preventable?

A: Absolutely. Standard security protocols in software development include multiple code reviews and security audits. Had Global Tech followed industry standards, this backdoor would have been detected before deployment.

Q: What is the estimated damage from this breach?

A: Based on the data exfiltration logs, approximately 2.3 million customer records were compromised. Using industry standard calculations for data breach costs, the estimated damage ranges from $15 million to $25 million.

MR. CHEN: No further questions, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Cross-examination, Ms. Rodriguez?

CROSS EXAMINATION
BY MS. RODRIGUEZ:

Q: Dr. Williams, you've been paid $350 per hour for your work on this case, correct?

A: That's correct.

Q: And you've billed approximately 200 hours so far?

A: Approximately, yes.

Q: So you've earned $70,000 from this case?

A: Yes.

Q: Isn't it true that 80% of your consulting income comes from plaintiff-side work?

MR. CHEN: Objection, relevance.

THE COURT: I'll allow it. The witness may answer.

A: I work for both plaintiffs and defendants. The percentage varies by year.

Q: Dr. Williams, you stated that Global Tech's code contained a backdoor. But isn't it possible that this code was added after delivery by a rogue employee at ACME?

A: That's highly unlikely based on the evidence.

Q: But possible?

A: Technically possible, but the evidence strongly suggests otherwise.

Q: You mentioned that the backdoor communicated using Global Tech's "proprietary API structure." But isn't our API documented in publicly available developer guides?

A: Parts of it are public, but the specific implementation details I observed are not publicly documented.

Q: Dr. Williams, have you ever testified against Global Tech Solutions in any prior cases?

A: No.

Q: Have you ever been excluded as an expert witness in any court?

A: No.

MS. RODRIGUEZ: No further questions.

THE COURT: Redirect, Mr. Chen?

MR. CHEN: Just briefly, Your Honor.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION
BY MR. CHEN:

Q: Dr. Williams, regarding Ms. Rodriguez's question about the possibility of a rogue ACME employee - did you investigate that possibility?

A: Yes, extensively. I examined all access logs, employee backgrounds, and physical access records. There's no evidence to support that theory.

Q: And the $70,000 you've earned - does that include your testimony today?

A: No, that's purely for the investigation and report preparation. My testimony time is billed separately.

MR. CHEN: Thank you. Nothing further.

THE COURT: Dr. Williams, you may step down. We'll take a 15-minute recess. When we return, Ms. Rodriguez, you may call your first witness.

[RECESS]

---

THE COURT: Back on the record. Ms. Rodriguez, please call your first witness.

MS. RODRIGUEZ: The defense calls Thomas Anderson, Chief Technology Officer of Global Tech Solutions.

[Witness sworn]

DIRECT EXAMINATION
BY MS. RODRIGUEZ:

Q: Mr. Anderson, how long have you been with Global Tech Solutions?

A: Fifteen years. I've been CTO for the last five years.

Q: Can you describe the quality control process for software development at Global Tech?

A: We have a rigorous multi-stage process. Every line of code goes through peer review, automated security scanning, and penetration testing before release. We're ISO 27001 certified and undergo annual third-party security audits.

Q: Were these procedures in place when you developed the software for ACME?

A: Absolutely. The ACME project went through our standard process plus additional security measures because it involved sensitive customer data.

Q: Mr. Anderson, have you reviewed Dr. Williams' report?

A: Yes, I have.

Q: Do you agree with his conclusions?

A: No, I do not. Dr. Williams makes several technical errors in his analysis. First, the "unique identifiers" he mentions are actually standard industry protocols used by dozens of companies. Second, our API structure is well-documented and publicly available. Third, his timeline analysis is flawed.

MR. CHEN: Objection. Mr. Anderson is not qualified as an expert and is offering expert testimony.

MS. RODRIGUEZ: Your Honor, Mr. Anderson is testifying about his own company's procedures and software. This is fact testimony, not expert opinion.

THE COURT: I'll allow the testimony regarding Global Tech's procedures. As to the technical rebuttals of Dr. Williams' opinions, I'll give those statements appropriate weight in my analysis. Objection overruled. Continue.

Q: You mentioned a timeline analysis flaw. Can you explain?

A: Dr. Williams claims the malicious code was present before delivery to ACME. However, we maintain version control records showing the exact state of the code at delivery. The backdoor functionality he describes was not present in that version.

Q: Do you have those version control records?

A: Yes, we produced them in discovery.

MS. RODRIGUEZ: Your Honor, I'd like to mark Defense Exhibit 12, which is a compilation of Global Tech's version control logs.

THE COURT: Any objection?

MR. CHEN: May I have a moment to review?

THE COURT: You may.

[Pause]

MR. CHEN: No objection to admission, Your Honor, but we maintain these records could have been altered.

THE COURT: The exhibit is admitted. That goes to weight, not admissibility. Continue, Ms. Rodriguez.

Q: Mr. Anderson, what is your theory about how this breach occurred?

A: Based on the evidence, I believe the breach occurred through a vulnerability in ACME's own network security, not through our software. They had several endpoints that were not properly secured, including outdated firewall rules and unpatched systems.

MS. RODRIGUEZ: No further questions.

CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. CHEN:

Q: Mr. Anderson, you testified that every line of code is reviewed. Who reviewed the code for the ACME project?

A: Our senior development team, including myself.

Q: And yet, according to your own security audit logs from 2023, your company had 47 vulnerabilities flagged in various projects, correct?

A: Yes, but none were in the ACME project specifically.

Q: But it shows your process isn't perfect, doesn't it?

A: No process is perfect, but we address all vulnerabilities promptly.

Q: Mr. Anderson, isn't it true that one of your senior developers, David Kim, left the company abruptly in February 2024, one month before the breach?

A: He resigned to take another position.

Q: Did you investigate whether he might have inserted the backdoor before leaving?

A: We conducted a routine exit review but found nothing suspicious.

Q: A routine review - not a forensic analysis?

A: Correct.

Q: So you can't rule out that Mr. Kim inserted malicious code?

A: I can't rule it out 100%, but it's highly improbable given our controls.

MR. CHEN: No further questions.

THE COURT: Any redirect?

MS. RODRIGUEZ: No, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Mr. Anderson, you may step down. It's now 11:30. We'll break for lunch and reconvene at 1:30 PM. At that time, I'll hear closing arguments from both sides. This breach has significant implications, and I want to carefully consider all evidence before ruling.

MR. CHEN: Your Honor, before we break, I'd like to renew our motion for judgment based on the evidence presented.

THE COURT: That motion is premature. I want to hear closing arguments and review all exhibits. The motion is denied without prejudice to renewal after closings. Court is in recess.

[END OF MORNING SESSION]

AFTERNOON SESSION - CLOSING ARGUMENTS

THE COURT: We're back on the record. Mr. Chen, you may present your closing argument.

MR. CHEN: Thank you, Your Honor. The evidence is clear and compelling. Dr. Williams, an impartial expert with impeccable credentials, has demonstrated through rigorous technical analysis that the breach originated from Global Tech's software. The backdoor was present at delivery, utilized Global Tech's proprietary protocols, and caused devastating harm to ACME Corporation.

Global Tech's defense relies on speculation about rogue employees and unsubstantiated attacks on Dr. Williams' credibility. Mr. Anderson's testimony, while self-serving, actually corroborates key aspects of our case. He admitted their security processes aren't perfect and that they never conducted a forensic investigation of David Kim's departure.

Your Honor, ACME trusted Global Tech with its most sensitive asset - customer data. That trust was betrayed, either through negligence or malfeasance. The damages are quantifiable: $15 to $25 million in direct costs, plus immeasurable reputational harm. We ask the court to find in favor of ACME Corporation and award full damages plus costs. Thank you.

THE COURT: Ms. Rodriguez?

MS. RODRIGUEZ: Thank you, Your Honor. This case is about burden of proof, and the plaintiff has failed to meet it. Dr. Williams is not impartial - he's a paid consultant who has earned $70,000 and counting from this case. His analysis contains fundamental technical errors that Mr. Anderson clearly identified.

The version control records - authenticated records produced in discovery - prove that the alleged backdoor was not present in the software delivered to ACME. Instead, the evidence shows ACME's own network security was woefully inadequate, with outdated systems and improper configurations.

Mr. Chen wants this court to award up to $25 million based on speculation and flawed analysis. That would be unjust. Global Tech Solutions followed industry best practices, maintained rigorous security protocols, and delivered secure software. What happened afterward at ACME's facilities is not our responsibility.

We respectfully request that the court find in favor of Global Tech Solutions and dismiss this action with prejudice. Thank you.

THE COURT: Thank you both. I've heard compelling arguments on both sides. This is a complex technical case with significant implications for both parties and the industry at large.

I'm going to take this matter under submission. I'll need time to review all exhibits, testimony transcripts, and expert reports carefully. Both parties should submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law within 14 days. I'll issue my ruling within 30 days after receiving those submissions.

A few preliminary observations: First, I'm concerned about the gaps in Global Tech's investigation of David Kim's departure. Second, I'm also concerned about ACME's network security practices. Third, the technical dispute between Dr. Williams and Mr. Anderson will require careful analysis of the underlying evidence.

MR. CHEN: Your Honor, may I request that Global Tech be ordered to preserve all evidence related to David Kim's employment and departure?

THE COURT: That's prudent. Ms. Rodriguez, is that an issue?

MS. RODRIGUEZ: No, Your Honor. We've already instituted a litigation hold on all relevant materials.

THE COURT: Good. I'm ordering both parties to preserve all evidence related to this matter until final disposition. Is there anything else before we adjourn?

MR. CHEN: Just a scheduling matter, Your Honor. We'd like to request that the deadline for proposed findings be extended to 21 days given the complexity of the issues.

MS. RODRIGUEZ: We'd join in that request.

THE COURT: Granted. Proposed findings and conclusions of law are due 21 days from today. I'll issue my ruling within 45 days after receiving those submissions. Anything else?

[No response]

THE COURT: Then we are adjourned. Thank you, counsel.
